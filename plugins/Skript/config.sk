# == Introduction ==
# This file contains the general options. To write scripts, make a new .sk file in the scripts folder or edit any existing one.
#
# Script files prefixed with a hyphen (-) will not be loaded, e.g. renaming 'plant with hoe.sk' to '-plant with hoe.sk' will disable the whole file.
# This can e.g. be used to temporarily disable scripts and is also used for Skript's example scripts.
# You can also use the command '/skript enable/disable <script>' to enable/disable a script which will automatically rename it.
#
# === !!! PLEASE NOTE !!! ===
# This file, all scripts and other files ending in .sk are NOT .yml/YAML files, but very similar!
# Please remember the following when editing files:
# - To indent sections you can use spaces like in YAML, but tabs are also allowed. Just remember to stick to the one or the other for the whole file.
# - '#' starts a comment like in YAML. If you don't want it to start a comment simply double it: '##'.
# - If you use special characters (§, äöü, éèàôç, ñ, etc.) you have to encode the file in UTF-8.
#

language: english
# Which language to use. Currently english and german are included in the download, but custom languages can be created as well.
# Please note that not everything can be translated yet, so part of Skript will still be in English if you use another language.
# If you want to translate Skript to your language please read the readme.txt located in the /lang/ folder in the jar
# (open the jar as zip or rename it to Skript.zip to access it)

check for new version: false
# Whether Skript should check for whether a new version of Skript is available when the server starts.
# If this is set to true Skript will announce a new version to all players with the "skript.admin" permission.
# If set to false you can still check for a new version with '/skript update check'
# Please note that Skript will not detect beta releases even if you are running one as they are not neccessarily stable.
update check interval: 12 hours
# If 'check for new version' is enabled, this sets how often to check for a new update.
# A first check will always be made when the server starts, after that checks will be made in intervals set by this option.
# Set this to 0 to disable repeated checks, in which case only one check will be made when the server starts.
# Please note that this option is currently the only means of making Skript check for an update more than once,
# as '/skript update check' does only display the results of the last check if a check has been made before.
automatically download new version: false
# Whether Skript should automatically download & install the newest version if one is available.
# I suggest to disable this feature if your server restarts automatically as you likely won't be informed
# of any incompatibilities of your scripts and the newest version of Skript.
# If you disable this you can still use '/skript update download' to make Skript download the newest version.
# If you're concerned about changes use '/skript update changes' for a full list of changes since your current version.

enable effect commands: false
effect command token: !
# If 'enable effect commands' is set to true, chat messages starting with the 'effect command token' will be interpreted as effects and executed.
# A player needs the "skript.effectcommands" permission to use such commands,
# which does not default to OPs since these commands can do severe damage to the world or crash the server.
# Some example commands which can be used if this setting is enabled:
#	!heal player - heals the player (doesn't do anything if used from the console)
#	!repair tool - repairs the currently held item
#	!broadcast "<red>Please read the rules!" - if you want to get rid of the quotes you have to define a custom command
#	!set time to 6:00 - sets the time in the current world
# The command can also be abused, so only give permission to trusted playes, like owners & co-owners:
#	!spawn 20 ender dragons - ultimate griefing, will destroy a large part of the world in a short time
#	!create explosion of force 10000 - likely crashes the server or at least hangs it up for a long time
#	!ban all players - as the effect implies



# ==== Variables ====

variables backup interval: 2 hours
# If this is set to something other than 0 the variables file will be backed up repeatedly.
# Please note that variables are saved constantly no matter what is set here.
# Backing up the file could cause Skript to hang while the backup is created. This does likely not happen if your server is running Java 7 though.

database:
	# Database to store variables in. This can either be used as a simple one-server-storage
	# where variables are written constantly but only read at server start,
	# or as a connection between multiple servers by monitoring the database for changes.
	#
	# To be able to use a database you'll need to download the plugin 'SQLibrary' from http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/sqlibrary/files/
	# and install it in your server's plugin directory like other plugins.
	#
	# !! Please note that this feature is experimental, i.e. might contain severe bugs!
	
	# Please also note that '/skript reload' will not reload this section, i.e. you'll have to restart Skript for changes to take effect.
	
	type: none
	# The type of the database. Currently only MySQL and SQLite are supported. Use 'none' for Skript's default CSV flatfile storage.
	
	pattern: .*
	# If you only want to store part of your variables in the database (e.g. only player stats), set this pattern to match only those variables.
	# Variables that don't match the pattern will be saved in the default flatfile format.
	# This pattern uses Regex syntax, e.g. use 'db_.*' (without the quotes) to store all variables prefixed with 'db_' in the database,
	# or use '.*' (the default value) to store all variables in the database.
	
	monitor changes: false
	monitor interval: 20 seconds
	# If 'monitor changes' is set to true, variables will repeatedly be checked for updates in the database (in intervals set in 'monitor interval').
	# ! Please note that you should set 'pattern', 'monitor changes' and 'monitor interval' to the same on all servers that access the same database!
	
	# MySQL configuration
	host: localhost
	port: 3306
	user: root
	password: pass
	database: skript
	
	# SQLite configuration
	file: ./plugins/Skript/variables.db



# ==== Miscellaneous Settings ====

date format: default
# The date format to be used when dates should be displayed.
# This can be 'default' to use Java's default date format for the system's language.
# The format is that of Java's SimpleDateFormat as defined here: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html
# some examples:
#  d/M/yyyy h:mm a => 15/7/2012 8:53 PM
#  dd.MM.yyyy, HH:mm => 16.03.2013, 09:33

verbosity: normal
# Determines how much info is logged.
# Allowed values: low, normal, high, very high, debug
# The highest you should go is very high, which prints quite a lot of useful information,
# including how much time each trigger takes to execute.
# Only use debug if you're programming an add-on for Skript, but even then you might usually not need it.

plugin priority: high
# Allowed values: lowest, low, normal, high, highest
# Change this if you encounter problems with other plugins, e.g.:
# - cancelled events: The event is cancelled by another plugin, but Skript handles the event nonetheless => increase priority
#                    (e.g. WorldGuard cancels events if a player doesnt have permission for the given region,
#                     and you made some 'place' triggers which should not bypass WorldGuard's protection)
# - effects '(un)cancel event': Another plugin should/should not process the event, but does/does not => decrease priority
# - effect 'drop': Another plugin doesn't process added drops => decrease priority
# - effects 'remove ... from drops'/'clear drops': Drops added by other plugins are not removed => increase priority
#                                                  Skript removes drops it shouldn't => decrease priority or specify which item types to remove

log player commands: true
# Whether Skript should log the usage of custom commands.
# They will be logged as [INFORMATION] in this format: '<player>: /<command> <arguments>'

number accuracy: 2
# How many digits should be displayed after the dot at maximum when displaying numbers.
# Zeroes will never be displayed at all, so this setting only applies to numbers that actually have a decimal part with one or more non-zero digits.

maximum target block distance: 100
# How far to search for a player's targeted block in blocks/meters.
# Lower values improve performance, but might reduce the usability of your scripts.
# This value is limited by the server (e.g. by 'view-distance' in the server.properties), but is guaranteed to work up to 100 meters.

case sensitive: false
# Whether Skript's functions should be case sensitive or not.
# This e.g. applies to the effect 'replace' and the conditions 'contains' and 'is/is not'.

disable variable conflict warnings: false
# Disables warnings of potential variable name conflicts if set to true.
# I recommend to not touch this option, but if you do so you should at least set it back to false
# whenever you create new scripts with new variables.



# ==== Settings that should not be changed ====

version: 2.0.2
# DO NOT CHANGE THIS VALUE MANUALLY!
# This saves for which version of Skript this configuration was written for.
# If it does not match the version of the .jar file then the config will be updated automatically.
