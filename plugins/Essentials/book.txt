&7[&3Getting Started&7]&r
Your first few days in minecraft have drastically changed. Vanilla wood &&
stone tools are disabled. Tinkers' Construct tool progression is: Wood > Bone/Cactus/Flint > Copper > Iron > Bronze.
All TCon tools have material restrictions in place, consult the pattern tooltips for details. TCon tools are now upgradable! Tools no longer have modifiers by default, you now gain mods upon leveling up the tool. Once you reach the copper tier, you will unlock Bonus XP. Bonus XP is used to unlock the next mining tier.
